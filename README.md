Paper-Style Tic Tac Toe

This is a web-based, fully responsive Tic Tac Toe game with a unique "paper-style" aesthetic. Built from scratch with vanilla HTML, CSS (using TailwindCSS), and JavaScript, it mimics the classic pen-and-paper feel by only showing the inner grid lines.

(I highly recommend you record a short GIF of the gameplay and place it here! It will make your portfolio look great. You can use a tool like LICEcap or Giphy Capture.)
